# Real_Estate_Price_prediction
I developed a real estate price prediction project using Python, leveraging linear regression to build a predictive model. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, providing robust information for training and testing. For the user interface, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a seamless front end that allows users to input variables and receive predicted property prices based on the model's calculations. This project not only showcases the application of machine learning in real estate but also integrates it with intuitive web development for practical user interaction.
